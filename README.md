This repository is the threshold search for fast inter coding, based on [https://github.com/Simon123123/MSMVF_VVC_TIP2023](https://github.com/Simon123123/MSMVF_VVC_TIP2023)
- (first step) MSMVF_VVC-dataset: generate the dataset for threshold search
- (second step) preprocess.py: preprocess the dataset
- (third step) threshold_search: search for the optimal thresholds
- (last step) MSMVF_VVC-opt: modify the thresholds of the baseline encoder
